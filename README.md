DREAM  
"DREAM" is an IOS mobile application that aims to help users record and analyze their dreams and how those dreams might reflect the user's real-life experiences. Right now, the analysis is done for fun and not based on any scientific models/approaches. 

Tools Used: 
- Swift, SwiftUI
- SwiftData
- SF Symbols
- OpenAI API
- OpenAIKit

Features: 
- Journal your dreams
- Record the date and emotions felt
- Review your dreams in the dream log
- Analysis with the help of ChatGPT 4 to see what you've been dreaming about for the past 7 days, and how your real-life status might be reflected, or affect your dreams. 

Obstacles:
- Upgrading to the correct IOS version for SwiftData to work.
- Figuring out how to Query data.
- Correctly assign the @State and @Binding variables and ensure that the @Binding variable's changes are carried over to the actual variable. Also, ensure that changes can be made to the Query variables.
- OpenAI API syntax and choosing which Swift Packages to use.

Future Additions: 
- Delete feature for dream logs
- Different interpretations for the dream entries using AI:
    - Creating a new story with the entries,
    - Creating an illustration with the entries,
    - Using the emotions entered in the dream analysis
